# QAUken Solutions

# C# Solution
In the CSharpChallenge folder, there contains two folders of importance: the Final_Build and QAUken.
Final_Build has an executable that will take in the files from the src folder, read them, and identify the number that appears the fewest amount of times.
Simply downloading this folder and running the executable within the folder will perform the task - follow the onscreen instructions after it is complete to exit the console window.

QA Uken is the project folder that I created the project from, where the entire script is housed within the Program.cs file.
This has been provided to show my work, it is not mandatory to run the project.


# Unity Solution
The folder marked UnityChallenge contains the Uken Project folder and the Final_Build Folder.
Entering the Final_Build folder will bring up the Trash Game build with the alterations requested, such as increased lives and missions.
To run this game, only the Final_Build folder is necessary; click on the .exe to play.

The Uken Project folder contains the original project itself in the Uken Project folder, to allow for clarity and to show what was altered. It is not required to run the .exe.

# Test Case Solution
Within the UnityChallenge folder there is a PDF called 'Gameplay Test Cases.pdf'.
This is where the test cases are for the gameplay of Trash Dash.
These tests include player movement, player interactions with obstacles and player interactions with power ups.
