# QAUken Solutions

# C# Solution
# In the C# Challenge folder, there contains two folders of importance: the Final_Build and QAUken.
# Final_Build has an executable that will take in the files from the src folder, read them, and identify the number that appears the fewest amount of times.
# Simply downloading this folder and running the executable within the folder will perform the task - follow the onscreen instructions after it is complete to exit the console window.

# QA Uken is the project folder that I created the project from, where the entire script is housed within the Program.cs file.
# This has been provided to show my work, it is not mandatory to run the project.


# Unity Solution
# The folder marked Unity Challenge contains the Uken Project folder and the Final_Build Folder.
# Entering the Final_Build folder will bring up the Trash Game build with the alterations requested, such as increased lives and missions.
# To run this game, download the Final_Build folder and run the .exe.

# The Uken Project folder contains the original project itself, to allow for clarity and to show what was altered. It is not required to run the .exe.
